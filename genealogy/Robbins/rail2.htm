<strong>Railway history</strong><BR>

Tramcars started to be used as early as the 1600's for haulage operation.  Improving steam engine technology and the introduction of steel tracks in the early 1800's initiated the emergence of railways.  The first steam locomotive for passenger service was introduced in 1829.  Both England and America advanced the use of railways at a fast pace during the middle to late 1800s.<BR><BR>

Australia's first railway opened in 1854 from Melbourne to Port Melbourne.  The major expansion of Victoria's railway system occurred during the late 1880s and early 1890s.  Between 1887 and 1892, no less than 1162 miles of track were added to Victoria's state network.  During the ensuing five years however, only a further 208 miles of railway were built, slowed down by the financial depression of the 1890s.  In those days each of Australia's six states was effectively a separate colony, with steam ships a comparative novelty and their visits extremely rare.<BR><BR>

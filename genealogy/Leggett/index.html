Edward Henry was at Fryers Creek gold diggings in late 1854, as his signature is on a memorial from the diggers at Forest Ck/Fryers Ck presented to Governor Charles Hotham in December 1854 regarding a levy tax on gold.  He was known to be farming at Bet Bet from at least 1864 to 1879. He is then listed as a farmer from Avoca Forest (now called Logan) in 1880.  The family then established a house at Berrimal (see photo), it being used as a temporary place for Methodist services in the early 1880's. Unfortunately, little information has come to life about the period from 1853 to 1864. <BR><BR>
  
Ruth Leggett died in 1897 at Mt. Korong, and by this time their three remaining children John Henry, Henry Edward and William James had married and were having children in the areas of Fentons Creek, Berrimal, Mt. Korong, Inglewood, and Melbourne South.  
Of interest is that the family raised Sarah Douglas as a child, along with their own children.  Sarah was born 1864 at Carisbrook (parents William Douglas & Susan Chesney), however her mother died in 1875 and it is thought that the two families must have been close.<BR><BR>

Many of Edward and Ruth's grandchildren remained in the general mid-central Victorian region, and known cemeteries to have family graves are Ararat, Dunolly, and Wedderburn.

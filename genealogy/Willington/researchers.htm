The information presented in this website is primarily a result of the efforts of Neil Symons, Judith Robbins, and Tim Robbins. Neil and Judith obtained substantial assistance from many relatives in developing the bulk of the genealogy information. Sadly, Neil passed away in 1999. We hope this website provides inspiration to you and others to continue to develop information regarding Symons genealogy.<BR><BR>We would be pleased to make contact with relatives who have undertaken genealogical research or who are interested in starting, or who think they may have information to assist us (such as family bibles, letters, wills etc.).<BR><BR><BR>

<strong>Some of the people who have contributed</strong><BR>

We have asked our researchers to give some insight into themselves and their work. This page gives their personal responses.</font><BR>

My involvement in family genealogy has only been over the last few years. As a long-time regular user of the internet/computers, I have assisted with the transfer of our database to Family Tree Maker, and the construction of this website.<BR><BR>The design of this website has been on the keep-it-simple HTML-only principle, with no frames used and only insignificant use of Java script. The HTML code used should be compatible with all browsers - if not then please email any problems detected. The content width of pages has been sized at 700 pixels to make for acceptable viewing at 800x600 and higher display settings (this is a compromise, as 640x480 settings will not display properly). I use MS Notepad to code the HTML, Adobe Photoshop for graphics, Adobe Acrobat 4 to generate PDF files, MS Internet Explorer to view pages, and CuteFTP for upload. I have employed Adobe Acrobat Reader and Text files where appropriate and elbow grease elsewhere. The file sizes of all web pages, .PDF and .TXT files, and graphics have intentionally been kept small.</font><BR><BR>

      <b>SELF-SPLIT PUSH-PULL OUTPUT STAGE INFORMATION</b>
      <br />
      <br />
      Following is a list of links and articles relating to Self-Split Push-pull valve amplifier output stage configurations.
      A key advantage of the self-split technique is to eliminate the phase-inverter tube(s) for a push-pull output stage.
      Typically, the driven push-pull tube operates only in Class A, and the other push-pull tube has a cloned signal applied to it - so max output power level is lower than for Class AB.
      Furthermore, cloned signal linearity can suffer as grid-conduction and cutoff regions of operation of the driven tube are approached, so acceptable output power can be even lower.
      <br />
      <br />
      The screen driven self-split technique was patented from 1936 by E.L. Clark from Philco in <a href="/static/US2109021.pdf">US2109021</a>, with an improvement patented from 1941 by W.E. Gilbert in <a href="/static/US2361282.pdf">US2361282</A>.
      Philco used it in some of their radios from 38-3 (circa 1938).
      Magnatone used it in their Melodier 109 (late 1950's) and Davis 106 (circa ?).

      The 15k PP OT in the class A 6M5 design presents very close to textbook 7k loadline.
      With idle plate voltage of 260V, screen at 205V, and idle bias of 6.4V, the cathode currents are 32+32mA for 7-8W anode dissipation.
      Each speaker is a Rola 8H 3.5ohm at 6Wpk spec, so a 4Vpk swing on the speakers would give 4.5W output and remain out of grid-conduction and cutoff regions for the driven tube.
      The 64mA cathode idle current would not be an issue in the OT secondary and the speaker voice coils.

      <b>SELMER CONCERT ORGAN</b>
      <br />
      <br />           
      I am happy to share details on the restoration of the Selmer Concert organ.
      Links provided to the Selmer Concert service manual, and the earlier  Selmer Lincoln service manual, and some general informative articles relating to electronic organs.
      I also have a more detailed design doc and other details on the Concert organ.

      The Concert, and its ecclesiastical brother the Minster model, are believed to be Selmer's last in-house organs.
      Selmer transitioned to Clavioline keyboards and Lowrey organs in the 1960's.
      <br />
      <br />
      Selmer preceeded the Concert model with the Theatre model and its ecclesiatical brother the Lincoln model - Robert Quayle prepared this scan of a transcribed
      <a href="/projects/SelmerLincolnOrganManual.pdf">Selmer Lincoln Organ Service Manual</a>
      Manufactured from circa 1954, <a href="/projects/SelmerLincolnNotes.pdf">notes on the Lincoln organ along with photos by Robert Quayle are here.</a>
      Apparently Selmer started organ manufacture circa 1951, so there should be an earlier Selmer organ model before the Lincoln and Theatre models of 1954.

      Coupleaux and Givelet must have had an exciting time as they developed ways to generate and control electronic notes in the late 1920's and early 1930's.
      They were able to install many imposing organs, <a href="http://120years.net/the-orgue-des-ondes-armand-givelet-edouard-eloi-coupleux-france-1929/"> such as at Villemomble in 1931</a>, although the maintenance must have been horrendous with valve numbers in the many 100's.
      Their <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/1957392.pdf">1930 patent</a> discloses the many, if not crude, techniques to generate and couple tones to speakers, and ways to change the timbre (including controlled speaker distortion) and vibrato (such as by mechanically vibrating core parts in an inductor).
      Meissner's <a href="http://discretesynthesizers.com/archives/miessner/em1936.htm">1936 discussion on electronic instruments</a> illustrates the dramatic growth in interest and developments and patents at the turn of the 20's decade.

      <b>AUSTRALIAN WILLIAMSON AMPLIFIER SYSTEM</b>
      <br />
      <br />
      I am happy to share details on the restoration of three Williamson amplifiers I am renovating.
      One is Australian built with a control unit.
      Another is also Australian built - possibly by AWA - using Red Line transformers and chokes.
      And another is English built by Miller Organs for probably a Classic IV organ that came to Australia circa 1960.
      Links and a brief summary are also provided to a compendium of Williamson amplifier articles.
      <br />
      <br />
      The Williamson amplifier abruptly garnered widespread interest with the technical community in England, Australia and USA in 1947-1949 through articles in the Wireless World magazine, and possibly was the most updated amplifier design of its time.
      It effectively spearheaded a significant boost in amplifier performance that coincided with speaker and recording improvements to meet a growing post-war appreciation and demand for hi-fi reproduction.
      In Britain, the hi-fi manufacturers Rodgers, Goodsell, E.M.G. and Expert put Williamson amplifier designs at the top of their product range, and Pilot Radio, Radio Craftsmen, Sun Radio, Harvey Radio, Heathkit, Knight, and Pedersen made versions in USA, and Electrohome in Canada, with manufacturers like Grommes making more substantial changes to the circuit.
      Australia however didn't seem to have a widespread commercial uptake, although initial technical interest was high and a number of kit and part makers supported the amplifier.
      <br />
      <br />
      This Australian amplifier is commercially made, but unbranded, and appears to be from circa 1952-3.
      It uses the 1949 'new' version of the Williamson circuit, with a few practical but subtle changes.
      The control unit has the typical preamp layout of the time, with switched bass and treble settings, and the LP, 78A, and 78B compensation settings for the records of the time.

      A credit to Williamson is buried deep in the article.
      The feedback level is made switchable from 0 to 20dB, and a few paragraphs alert the user to potential instability for certain output transformer and speaker choices, and a need for appropriate test equipment if high levels of feedback are to be entertained.

      The author's effectively introduced the Williamson amplifier to USA with this article.
      The only differences to Williamson's 'new' circuit were triode connected 807's, some changes to the powering circuitry, and a somewhat simplified bias current setup, although the input stage phase margin improvement RC network was not included (probably due to short time since the August WW had been available).
      At that time, the authors could only identify the Peerless S-265Q output transformer as being suitable for the task.

      In November 1951 the dutch Radio Bulletin magazine presented <a href="/static/Modern amplifiers.pdf"> an article on the Williamson to its readers</a>.
      The initial paragraph translates as "It is certainly interesting for the RB reader who has no access to foreign journals to appreciate the field of modern quality amps around the world even before they are for sale.
      In recent years in particular a design has acquired great renown: the "Williamson".
      The first publication in "Wireless World" dates from April '47 and is the work of D. T. N. Williamson, which is connected to the Ferranti factories.
      The best proof of the extraordinary qualities of this design is probably the fact that in America there is a growing demand for the material produced by the English factories, according to the Williamson specification!"

      Design factors of Williamson circuit used in the Radio Craftsman Model 500 by their chief engineer.
      Radio Craftsmen introduced the 500 amp in late 1951.
      Of note is the change from first stage anode 47k load shunting by 200pF/4k7 shelf filter (17kHz corner), to a 2k7/560pF load to ground, and the addition of some phase lead by paralleling 68pF across the 4k7 feedback resistor (500kHz corner).
      Also, the main capacitor coupling corner frequencies were staggered from 6.3 and 7Hz in the Williamson, to 0.7 and 16Hz in the 500.
      To further improve noise performance, the valve heaters were 40VDC elevated to the output stage cathode level.

      Apart from the UL related changes, the authors also staggered the capacitor coupling corner frequencies for better low-frequency stability (7Hz reduced to 1.4Hz for first coupling), added some phase lead with the feedback resistor (150kHz corner), and bypassed the output stage cathode resistance for lower 3rd harmonic distortion.

Knapp in May 1954 - Knapp was from UTC, and the proposed amplifier had little similarity to the Williamson circuit.
      Of interest was that some type of a Williamson amp was assessed for performance, with particular focus on how the out-of-band peaking from a lack of low and high frequency step networks could affect low frequency transient response (eg. from turntable rumble), and high frequency response from increasingly capacitive speaker impedance - however the article does not disclose the output transformer used for testing, so measured results may be quite uncharacteristic of the original Williamson performance.

      Sept 1954, Audio - Versatile control unit for the Williamson, pp 19-21,78, by Charles R. Miller. A series connection of the preamp valve heaters are powered from the Williamson output stage common cathode voltage of 40VDC, and neons are used to avoid voltage limit problems if the heater connection goes open circuit.

      HMV initially used a Williamson amplifier module in their <a href="/static/HMV3000.pdf"> flagship model 3000 range of radiograms </a> introduced from 1955.
      In 1956, a standalone <a href="/static/HMV3051.pdf">amplifier model 3051 </a> along with a preamplifier model 3050 were coupled with 5 speakers as a 3052.
      A few common circuit changes were introduced to the amplifier, including the step network, increased input/splitter decoupling capacitor values, and staggered coupling cap values, along with using the 12AU7.

      UTC W-10 Williamson amplifier used to measure THD and IM with/without a bypass capacitor for KT66, 5881, and 1614 output valves, and for varying degrees of circuit unbalance.
      In general, results showed that THD could rise or fall, depending on the valve.
      CCIF IM results in general showed a slight improvement at higher output power levels with the bypass capacitor.

      <a href="https://antiqueradio.org/art/HeathkitW-6MAmplifierManual.pdf">The Heathkit 70W W-6M Amplifier</a> from 1957 had many changes from the original Williamson circuit - including variable current feedback to modify the damping factor, an additional cathode follower driver stage that integrates fixed biasing for the 6550 UL output stage, and ss rectifiers.
      The operating manual includes technical performance details for overload recovery.

      Hafler describes modifications including using EL34/6CA7 with a Dynaco A-430 output transformer, along with his 1955 mods, but also identifies the risk of adding the 1 Meg bypass of coupling caps, and the performance change with the high-frequency 100pF feedback from driver to input stage.
      The other major change is removing the cathode bias resistors, and including a fixed bias circuit.
